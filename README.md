## About this project:
I was interested in the lecture about fractal structures in this course [Chaotic Dynamics](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/) and impressed by the [beauty](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/googleearth/) of these infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Here is a JavaScript implementation of a stunningly gorgeous fractal tree.
