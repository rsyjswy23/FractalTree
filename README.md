## About this project:
A JavaScript implementation of stunningly gorgeous fractal tree. 

## What is the fractal tree?
A fractal is a pattern that the laws of nature repeat at different scales. Examples are everywhere in the forest. Trees are natural fractals, patterns that repeat smaller and smaller copies of themselves to create the biodiversity of a forest.
